# Front End Libraries Certification - Redux

Introduction to the Redux Challenges

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. While you can use Redux with any view library, it's introduced here before being combined with React.
